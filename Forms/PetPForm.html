    <h2>Comissions Policy</h2>
    
    <p>A non-refundable downpayment of 20% is required to begin the design process.
        This secures your spot and covers initial concept sketches and communication.
        Payments details will be provided upon acceptance of your request.
        Once the final design is approved, the remaining balance (total price - downpayment) will be due before delivery.
        Upon receipt of full payment, you will receive:</p>
           <ul> 
           <li>A full-color painting mailed straight to you!</li>
           <li>A high-resolution digital file of your comission.</li>
           <li>A lil gift <3.</li>

           </ul>
       <p> The commission includes 2 rounds of revisions in case you want to fine-tune the design.
        The typical turnaround is 3-4 weeks, depending on complexity and current workload.
        Youâ€™ll receive regular updates throughout the process.
        I reserve the right to share the completed design in my portfolio or social media unless you request otherwise.
        Once the initial sketches have been sent, the downpayment becomes fully non-refundable.
        If I am unable to complete your design for any reason, you will receive a full refund.</p>
        <p>By submitting your commission request, you agree to these terms. ðŸ’•</p>
